/* You can now wield SQL to find where, when, and how users are visiting a website.
UTM parameters are a way of tracking visits to a website. Developers, marketers, and analysts use them to capture information like the time, attribution source, and attribution medium for each user visit.
First-touch attribution only considers the first source for each customer. This is a good way of knowing how visitors initially discover a website.
Last-touch attribution only considers the last source for each customer. This is a good way of knowing how visitors are drawn back to a website, especially for making a final purchase.
Find first and last touches by grouping page_visits by user_id and finding the MIN and MAX of timestamp.
To find first- and last-touch attribution, join that table back with the original page_visits table on user_id and timestamp. */
